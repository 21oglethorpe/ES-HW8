You are working for a company that designs soda vending machines. A particular machinewill vend soda after 3 quarters are given to it.
Draw a black box diagram, design a state machine, draw a state diagram with state table, minimize the logic, and draw a circuit for 
the vending machinecontroller. This is an open ended question, please specify any sort of sensors or inputs your machine will need.
PS                            NS q=0     q=1                              output(vend)

NS1 = (q AND PS0) XOR PS1
NS0 = PS1' AND (q XOR PS0)
vend = q AND PS1*PS0
